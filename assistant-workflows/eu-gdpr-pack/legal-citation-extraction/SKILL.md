# Legal Citation Extraction

You can only verify what you first find. Grounding a citation checks whether it exists in the source - but it runs on a list that someone has to assemble first. This workflow is that front-end: it walks the text and lists every authority, so none slips past verification. A missed citation is an unverified one.

Extraction is mechanical - by patterns and rules, not by judgement - on purpose: an unconstrained reading might miss a citation or invent one.

## Three steps

1. Extraction - recognise and capture every reference by the patterns below.
2. Aggregation - resolve short references (ibid., id., supra, op. cit., "the above-cited judgment") to their antecedents by the pointer-aware rules below, so they count as one citation, not several.
3. Hand-off - pass the structured list to verification: does each cited authority exist, and does it say what the text claims.

## Citation patterns

### Case law
- ECLI (EU): `ECLI:EU:C:2020:559` (Court of Justice), `ECLI:EU:T:2019:...` (General Court).
- ECLI (national): `ECLI:NL:HR:2021:...`, `ECLI:DE:BGH:...`, `ECLI:PL:SN:...`.
- Case names and numbers: `Party v Party`; CJEU case numbers `C-123/20`, `C-123/20 P` (appeal), joined cases `C-123/20 and C-124/20`; General Court `T-456/19`.

### EU legislation
- CELEX: `32016R0679`, `32019L0790` (sector + year + type + number).
- Named acts: `Regulation (EU) 2016/679`, `Directive 2019/790`, `Regulation (EC) No 1/2003`.
- Official Journal: `OJ L 119`, `OJ C 326`.

### Provisions
- `Article 5(1)(a) GDPR`, `Art. 263 TFEU`, `section 12`, `§ 3(2)`.

## Aggregation - short references

Short reference forms carry different resolution rules - they cannot all be sent to the nearest antecedent:

- `ibid.`, `id.`, `loc. cit.` - refer to the immediately preceding authority.
- `supra`, `op. cit.` - often carry a pointer that overrides proximity: an author name, a title fragment, or a note number ("Kranenborg, op. cit., p. 12"; "supra note 14"). Resolve by the pointer first; fall back to proximity only when the reference is bare.
- Descriptive forms (`the cited judgment`, `the above-cited`) - match by the described attributes (court, party, subject), not by position alone.

Where more than one antecedent matches, or none does, mark the reference **unresolved - manual review** instead of guessing: a wrong merge silently fuses two distinct authorities into one. Count each resolved reference as the same citation as its antecedent, but record where it occurs.

## Output format

A numbered table with columns: Type, Citation (normalised), Occurrences (page or offset), Antecedent (if a short reference). Close with the list of citations to verify.

## Limits

- Extraction catches references in a known format. A descriptive reference with no identifier ("the Court's data-protection case law") has nothing to match - mark it "no identifier, manual check".
- This is not existence verification - it says what is cited, not whether the citation is real.
- The patterns cover the common EU and ECLI formats; an unusual citation style may slip through. At high stakes, review by hand as well.

## Attribution

The extraction, aggregation, and annotation architecture follows eyecite (Free Law Project), BSD-2-Clause (https://github.com/freelawproject/eyecite), as a design pattern only - no eyecite code is used. US reporter patterns are dropped; the ECLI, CELEX, OJ, and EU citation patterns and the antecedent rules are the author's own.
